I'm a lawyer and researcher working on environmental law, climate policy, and legal theory. currently doing an LL.M. in climate change and environmental law at the [Jigme Singye Wangchuck School of Law](https://www.jswlaw.bt/) in Bhutan, on a full scholarship. my field practicum involves working with the Royal Government of Bhutan on environmental frameworks for the Gelephu Mindfulness City.

Before this, i spent two years as a research fellow at [Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in), where i worked on environmental law research, wrote policy briefs for ministries and parliamentary committees, and helped prompt questions in the Lok Sabha. i've also worked independently — writing a report on inter-state river water disputes for IIM Ahmedabad and consulting for the Naz Foundation on queer and HIV rights.

I care about clear writing, good law, and the places where climate, ecology, and governance meet. i'm based between New Delhi and Bhutan. you can reach me at [himanshuclc2020@gmail.com](mailto:himanshuclc2020@gmail.com).
